# INTRODUCTION

This is a simple react application called "DAD JOKE". In this application, I am fetching jokes from an API and rendering those JOKES based on few conditition.

# CHALLENGES

1. This is the first time I am using API call in the react application so I learnt to make API call in the react application using AXIOS library.

2. Next challenge that I was facing of storing the Jokes each time it is being fetched. As for now I was not knowing to connect the database with the application, So I learnt how to store the data in local storage of the browser.

3. Next challenge that I was facing is that everytime when I fetch new jokes from the API, I need to know that which joke are brand new jokes which are now in the local storage so that we can save the our joke list with duplicate items.

4. Next challenge in this project was to give the rating of the jokes and according to that rating I needed to change the expression of the smiley for that particular joke.


# WHAT DID I LEARN FROM THIS PROJECT

1. Making an API call.
2. Getting the data from the response of the API call.
3. Handling error in the API call.
4. setting and getting item in the local storage of the browser.
5. React component lifecycle.
